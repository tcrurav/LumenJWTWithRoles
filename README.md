# API RESTful using Lumen PHP Framework with JWT and Roles

Example of API RESTful using Lumen PHP Framework with JWT and Roles.

## Getting Started

I recommend you here some links I have found very helpful to build this example.

To start building a JWT Authenticated API with lumen:
https://dev.to/ndiecodes/build-a-jwt-authenticated-api-with-lumen-2afm

It's also very interesting this tutorial which explains a role-based API using laravel (Only the first part of the tutorial. For the purpose of this project is not so interesting the Vue.js part of it):

### Prerequisites

All you need is... some time and...
* Visual Studio Code.
* MySQL Workbench, to host the database also included in the project.
* PostMan, for the RESTFul tests.
* More hours than you first could think of...
